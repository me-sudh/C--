    1 dimesional char array;

    Key Differences Between Character Array and String
    1. A character array is a collection of variables which are of character datatype. String is a class that is instantiated to declare strings.
    2. Using index value you can access a character from a character array. On the other hand, if you want to access a particular character in a string, you can access it by function stringâ€™s_name.charAt(index).
    3. As an array is not a datatype similarly a character also is not a datatype. On the other hand, String being a class act as a reference type hence, it can be said String is a data type.
    4. You can not apply any operator on a character array whereas, you can apply operators on String.
    5. Being an array character array has a fixed length and its boundaries can be easily overrun. Where String does not have any boundaries.
    6. Array elements are stored in a contiguous memory location hence that can be accessed faster than string variable.

// C++ program to demonstrate getline() function-----------------------------------
  
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
  
int main()
{
    string str;
  
    cout << "Please enter your name: \n";
    getline(cin, str);
    cout << "Hello, " << str<< " welcome to GfG !\n";
  
    return 0;
}

//we can also use custom delimitors to stop code from accepting------------------------------------------------
#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

//macro definitions
#define MAX_NAME_LEN 60 // Maximum len of your name can't be more than 60
#define MAX_ADDRESS_LEN 120 // Maximum len of your address can't be more than 120
#define MAX_ABOUT_LEN 250 // Maximum len of your profession can't be more than 250

int main () {
char y_name[MAX_NAME_LEN], y_address[MAX_ADDRESS_LEN], about_y[MAX_ABOUT_LEN];

cout << "Enter your name: ";
cin.getline (y_name, MAX_NAME_LEN);

cout << "Enter your City: ";
cin.getline (y_address, MAX_ADDRESS_LEN);

cout << "Enter your profession (press $ to complete): ";
cin.getline (about_y, MAX_ABOUT_LEN, '$'); //$ is a delimiter

cout << "\nEntered details are:\n"<<'\n';
cout << "Name: " << y_name << endl;
cout << "Address: " << y_address << endl;
cout << "Profession is: " << about_y << endl;
}
